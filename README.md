# NASA-Space-App-Challenege-Hackathon-2024
 Objective of the 2024 NASA Space Apps Challenge 
The 2024 NASA Space Apps Challenge is an international hackathon designed to foster 
innovative solutions to pressing global issues using open-source NASA data. This year's 
challenge focuses on modeling the relationship between climate change and gender 
inequality. The goal is to understand how climate action and gender equality can be addressed 
together to promote sustainable development for all. 
Participants are tasked with: 
 Modeling the Intersection: Using open-source data, teams must analyze how climate 
change disproportionately affects gender minorities and propose solutions that promote 
equality and sustainability. 
 Designing Solutions: Teams are encouraged to design innovative tools such as data 
visualization dashboards, interactive websites, or localized community solutions. 
Solutions should address both the gender-specific impacts of climate change and how 
gender-inclusive policies can strengthen climate resilience.
